# Bulirsch-Stoer-Instability
Bulirsch-Stoer instability in ORSA visualised with Java Plotly.

- EccentricitySimulation.java &nbsp;&nbsp; A Java program for visualising orbital element variation with the Tablesaw wrapper for Plotly.<br />
- ORSA_Output.csv &nbsp;&nbsp; Jovian and Saturnian eccentricity and inclination evolution data, as calculated via analytical means, and as simulated using Runge-Kutta and Bulirsch-Stoer integration in ORSA.<br />
- pom.xml &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maven dependencies to make Tablesaw available, specified as a Project Object Model.

These files may be used in conjunction with e.g., Eclipse.
